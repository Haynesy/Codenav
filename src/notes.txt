Version 1

- 3D Interface with blocks.
    Use maybe standard OpenGL 2.1 techniques.
- Orthographic view for menus and options.
- Show folder structure in 3D using blocks.
- Open Files in folder structure.
    Classes or program structure folded by default (Possible show program structure metrics).
    Can choose to have interfaces applied to the object or separated (Will only apply to code in the src project,
        there should be an option to allow all ).
- Find or create a token parser to pass programming language files.
- Add notes to files.
- Re-arrange 3D blocks into groups, with ability to re-position groups for better organisation.

Addition notes
    - Interaction like the game homeworld
    - Background like homeworld
    - Maybe vim modes e.g Command, Edit, View
